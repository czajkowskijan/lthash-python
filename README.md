# Python implementation of the LtHash hash function

Researchers from Facebook recently ([paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/227.pdf)) implemented LtHash, initially proposed by [Bellare and Micciancio](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-69053-0_13.pdf).

The feature thath makes LtHash special is _set homomorphism_. It means that for any sets _A_, _B_, we have _H(A u B)=H(A)+H(B)_, where by _A u B_ we mean set union.

The python script uses the [PyCrypto](https://pycryptodome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/installation.html) library to run SHAKE128, the eXtendable Output Function from the SHA3 standard.
